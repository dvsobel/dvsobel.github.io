"The ability to search, select things and get to your results is much more powerful than what I can do today... and get more information (about the form) in one place."</p>

<p class="bodytext">

	<strong> Problem Statement: </strong> <br> There is no way to compare two editions of a form. Users must go to three different products (Forms Library, FIRST, and EFD products) to access documents, information, and related content.
<br>
<br>
	<strong>Our Solution:</strong> <br> The Forms Library redesign will provide consolidated access to ISO's 30,000+ forms documents, information, and related content in one product.

	<strong> Empathize: Voice of the Customer </strong> <br>
	We interviewed several external and internal customers to gather qualitative feedback. We ran a medallia survey and received 450 replies.
	After the interviews and surveys, we analyzed the responses from the qualitative/quantitative information.
	From there I developed themes from our takeaways and defined use cases and identified scenarios
	that supported our use cases.

	<strong> Define: </strong> <br>
	At this stage we clearly develop measurable goals, KPI's and PI's as a team. These were two examples:<br>
	-Measure the success of viewing a form along with the detail tab. <br>
	-Also, measure the success of users running reports- measure the frequency of running it.

	<strong> Ideate: Whiteboarding Workshop </strong> <br>
	I faciliated a few collaborative workshops to generate ideas from a theme with the development team and leadership.
	One of the benefits of ideation is that it promotes collaboration to help resolve user pain points. Below you can see part of our process.

 In the beginning of ideation, we were still working in the office.
 Because of COVID19, we were all sent to work from home and started using Miro as our main way
 to ideate. This is a zoomed out image of our ideation board. Its really cool to see the whole process here.

	<strong> Prototype:  </strong> <br>
	Our team (including product, dev and UX-me) got together to decide on the MVP. We discussed our use cases and what will
	bring our users the most value vs the complexity of developing the solution.<br><br>
  Use Cases:<br>
	1. Viewing/Downloading/Printing Form Document<br>
	2. Viewing/Downloading/Printing the form information and all related content<br>
	3. Viewing/Downloading/Printing the form search result <br>
	4. Delivery of entitled forms documents <br>
	5. Refining result set on the search results page<br>
	6. Document comparison<br><br>


	Once we landed on the MVP, I designed a rapid interactive prototype in Axure for the purpose of testing theme(s) and hypotheses
	by using design best practices and our deisgn system. Then, I reviewed the prototype with the team and told the story of how we got here.

	<strong> Validate: a heuristic evaluation with twenty-two participants. </strong> <br>
	I facilitated a qualitative usability study with selected users 1-on-1. Product team
	and stakeholders observed and took notes to provide insights on the design and user behaviors.
	We selected a range of participants from Attune Ins, Amerisure, Berkley National, Westbend, Clearfork, Chubb, Amtrust and more.
	For my process, I created a script, scheduled with participants using Calendly, scored how they did, and created a
	presentation for my team to show the findings.

	<br><br>
We learned that the participants liked the consolidation of form documents and information in one product. We got great
feedback on the new search enhancements, form comparison, and related content.
And users found it easier to work with and research policy language with history and relevant links in one place.
<br><br>
	For Scoring, I evaluated each of the users that participated in usability testing
	using the method below:
</p>

<span style="color: green"> <span class="material-icons">
sentiment_satisfied_alt
</span>
0 </span> Completed w/o problem </span>  <br>
<span style="color: gold">

sentiment_neutral
</span> 1</span> Completed with help </span>  <br>
<span style="color: red"> <span class="material-icons">
