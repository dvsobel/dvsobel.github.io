	<strong>  Background: </strong> <br> Before this product, our users were not able to access Loss Cost
	information for multiple states in a Line of Business at the same time. They needed to create their own spreadsheets and
	sift through multiple PDF documents to get the information they need which takes a ton of time.
<br>
<br>
	<strong>Our Solution:</strong> <br> The solution was to allow customers to obtain state-level loss cost data
	in one file, by line of business, for all states in which they participate.

	<strong> Empathize: Voice of the Customer </strong> <br>
	During VOC studies, UX can help elicit, organize, and parse feedback via user analytics, customer support, emails, posts,
	customer surveys, contextual inquiries, etc. into logical themes to determine business value, bug fixes
	and identify metrics for revenue growth and cost savings. I conducted a Medallia Survey and individual remote interviews with 5 users.

	<strong> Define: </strong> <br>
	At this stage we clearly develop measurable goals, KPI's and PI's as a team.

<p class="bodytext">
	<strong> Ideate: Whiteboarding Workshop </strong> <br>
	I faciliated a collaborative workshop to generate ideas from a theme with the development team and leadership.
	One of the benefits of ideation is that it promotes collaboration to help resolve user pain points. After the workshop we all agreed on this basic wireframe.

	<strong> Prototype: Axure </strong> <br>
	I designed a rapid interactive prototype in Axure for the purpose of testing theme(s) and hypotheses
	by using design best practices. The cool thing about prototyping in Axure is that we don't need to develop something
	in order to test. The Axure Share web enviroment looks exactly how a developer would
	develop it and all the interactions work too! This way, hopefully, after we test and iterate there will be less technical/development debt in the
	future.

	<strong> Validate: a heuristic evaluation with six users </strong> <br>
	I facilitated a qualitative usability study with selected users 1-on-1. Product team
	and stakeholders observed and took notes to provide insights on the design and user behaviors.
	We selected a range of participants from Munich Re, Attune, Liberty Mutual, AIG,
	AIG Banglore, and WR Berkley. I created a script that helped me figure out
	what I would like to test and ask the users. I asked a few preliminary questions such as how often they are downloading
	the file, what their process is when they receive the file, and what do they do when they open it.
	One thing we wanted to learn was whether our users were saving the files on their machines.
	By asking these questions, we found out that they save their files on their companies cloud
	space because they are important to them.

	<br><br>

	We also learned from our usability tests that this product made customer workflows faster and helped them reduce errors when processing and analyzing
	loss costs data. Before users needed to scrape PDFs for the information. The results were less manual labor, fewer errors, and more flexibility and efficiently using ISO data.
	Overall, our users were happy to have this product.
	<br><br> And Scoring, I evaluated each of the users that participated in usability testing
	using the method below:

  Outcome: These were the most important themes learned. Participants were able to use the fields to
	search for the loss cost information. Once they were finished getting the information
	they needed and wanted to go back to the prior page, most figured it out even the first time.

	<strong> Next steps </strong> <br>
The project went into development soon after usability testing. I sat and contributed in all Agile sprint ceremonies
until the final UX sign off. Right now, each of the files that the user can download are being
created manually by a team in Verisk. This is very time consuming. Going forward development is
working on a way that we don't need to continue to do such manual work so the file can just be
delivered live rather than monthly. Also we are tracking the application using Adobe Analytics
which helps us learn from our users usage.
